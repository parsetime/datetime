Notes:

    When used with the strptime() function, the %p directive only affects the output hour field if the %I directive is used to parse the hour.
    The range really is 0 to 61; value 60 is valid in timestamps representing leap seconds and value 61 is supported for historical reasons.
    When used with the strptime() function, %U and %W are only used in calculations when the day of the week and the year are specified.
    Produces different results depending on the value of time.accept2dyear variable. See Year 2000 (Y2K) issues for details.

Here is an example, a format for dates compatible with that specified in the RFC 2822 Internet email standard. [1]
